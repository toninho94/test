## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Sample R-Mardown document
```{r code block 1, results='hide'}

# This is a R-Code chunk

source("Yahoo Stock Data Pull.R")
AAPL <-  GetYahooData("AAPL")
IBM <- GetYahooData("IBM")
# Plotly chart 
library(plotly)
mat <-  data.frame(Date = AAPL$Date, 
                   AAPL = round(AAPL$Adj.Close,2),
                   IBM = round(IBM$Adj.Close,2))
p <- mat %>% 
  plot_ly(x = Date, y = AAPL, fill = "tozeroy", name = "Microsoft") %>% 
  add_trace(y = IBM, fill = "tonexty", name = "IBM") %>% 
  layout(title = "Stock Prices", 
         xaxis = list(title = "Time"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Stock Prices"))
p  # Thats it !

```
